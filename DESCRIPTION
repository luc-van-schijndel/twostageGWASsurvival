Description: Using a two stage method, it is possible to reduce the computational complexity of performing
  a GWAS which aims to detect epistasis between two SNPs. The total computation time is on the scale of months
  but not on the scale of centuries, as is the case for a naive approach. This package implements a function
  for applying this method to data obtained in a GWAS. It is recommended to perform this method on a large machine, 
  preferrably with parallel computing options.
