Description: Using a two stage method, it is possible to reduce the computational complexity
          of performing a GWAS which aims to detect epistasis between two SNPs. The total
          computation time is on the scale of months but not on the scale of centuries, as is
          the case for a naive approach. This package implements a function for applying this
          method to data obtained in a GWAS. It is recommended to perform this method on a
          large machine, preferrably with parallel computing options.
