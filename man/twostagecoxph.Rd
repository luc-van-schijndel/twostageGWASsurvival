\title{Perform a two stage analysis on a survival dataset to detect interactions assuming proportional hazards}
\usage{
twostagecoxph(
  survival.dataset,
  covariate.matrix,
  first.stage.threshold = 0.05,
  multiple.hypotheses.correction = "bonferroni",
  multicore = FALSE,
  updatefile = "",
  control = twostagecoxph.control(),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{survival.dataset}{The survival dataset describing the outcome.}

\item{covariate.matrix}{The nxp-matrix of covariates of the p covariates of the n patients. The dimensions may be named.}

\item{first.stage.threshold}{numeric scalar denoting the threshold for the first stage. If a covariate
is marginally more significant than this threshold, it will be passed on to the second stage.}

\item{multiple.hypotheses.correction}{Correction method, a character string. Passed to \code{\link{p.adjust}}.}

\item{multicore}{logical, default FALSE; whether or not the function should use multiple cores
in its calculations. See Details.}

\item{updatefile}{A \link{connection} to a text file where updates may be written. Necessary for parallel
computations, since the connection to the terminal will be lost. This
file will in that case serve as a stand-in for the terminal. Default
equals a connection to the terminal.}

\item{control}{object of class \code{twostagecoxph.control} specifying various options for performance
of the two stage method.}

\item{...}{other arguments to be passed to all calls to \code{coxph()} in this function.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{twostageGWAS}, which is a list of 7 entries:
  \item{result.list}{A list containing the results and where to find them in either 3 or 5 entries, depending on
  whether or not the covariates are named in the files:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{p.values}}{the non-trivial p-values of the interactions. The list is sorted in ascending
    order by this value. Any p-values that are either NA, 0, or 1 after possibly applying the
    multiple hypotheses correction will not be present in this vector.}
    \item{\code{index.one}, \code{index.two}}{the indices describing the two covariates that
    describe the interaction corresponding to the p-values in the previous entry. }
    \item{\code{names.one}, \code{names.two}}{if the covariates are named, these are the names
    of the covariates found on the aforementioned indices.}
  }}
  \item{most.significant.results}{A list describing the most significant results found. The
  number of results reported is specified by the control parameter, default 5. The
  list contains 3 items:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{interacting.snps}}{the names of the interaction, in \code{name_snp_1 x name_snp_2} format.
    In case the covariates in \code{covariate.matrix} have a names attribute, these names are used.
    Otherwise the index of the covariates within the matrix is used.}
    \item{\code{p.value.epistasis}}{the corresponding p-values of the interactions. Unless \code{return.raw = TRUE}
    is specified in the control parameter, these p-values will be corrected for the multiple hypotheses
    tested with the method specified by the \code{multiple.hypotheses.correction} parameter.}
    \item{\code{duplicate.interactions}}{the list of duplicate interactions found, corresponding to
    the interactions specified in this list. An interaction is said to be duplicate if the corresponding
    p-value is the same up until 7 significant figures. }
  }}
  \item{p.value.matrix}{A \code{sparseMatrix} object from the package \code{Matrix}, specifying the resulting
  upper triangular p-value matrix obtained from the second stage.  Unless \code{return.raw = TRUE}
    is specified in the control parameter, these p-values will be corrected for the multiple hypotheses
    tested with the method specified by the \code{multiple.hypotheses.correction} parameter. The names
    of the dimensions of the matrix match the ones specified in the files, if the \code{read.function} assigns
    dimnames to the matrix. The row and columns corresponding to covariates that were not named in the input
    matrix, have the string \code{as.character(NA)} for names (Note: not NA itself).}
  \item{marginal.significant}{A vector of named integers, specifying the indices of covariates which
  were found to be marginally significant in the first stage. }
  \item{first.stage}{A vector specifying the p-values found in the first stage. These p-values
  are \emph{not} corrected for the multiple tested hypotheses. }
  \item{fst}{The threshold for significance used in the first stage as specified in \code{first.stage.threshold}}
  \item{runtime}{The total runtime of the function in seconds.}
  \item{call}{The matched call.}
}
\description{
Performs a two stage analysis to find possible interactions influencing the time to event assuming
a Cox proportional hazards model. Most useful in cases where the covariates far outnumber the
subjects, e.g. in a Genome Wide Association Study. The function is based on two stage, wherein
the first one, all covariates are screened marginally for possible effects. In the second stage,
pairs of covariates from the ones found to be marginally significant are then tested for an
interaction effect.
}
\details{
It is shown in  that the two stages are independent of eachother. This results in
         proper control of rate of type I errors by the multiple hypotheses correction method.
         The power is also increased compared to a naive method, due to the fact that less
         hypotheses are tested in the second stage resulting in a less strict correction.
         The main advantage is that only a fraction of the possible interactions is tested,
         resulting in an enourmous decrease in computation times. \cr \cr
         If \code{multicore} is \code{TRUE}, the function assumes a proper parallel back-end is registered,
         e.g. one obtained from \code{doParallel::registerDoParallel(2)}, to be used by \code{foreach} and \code{\%dopar\%}. \cr \cr
         If memory constraints become an issue, \code{\link{batched.twostagecoxph}} is available.
         This function gives the user control in which parts of the set of covariates will
         be in active memory, allowing for better memory management. This does require the
         user to make its own partition of the covariates into separate files.
}
\note{
Parallel processing requires a properly registered parallel back-end, such as one obtained
        from \code{doParallel::registerDoParallel(2)} to be used by \code{foreach} and the \code{\%dopar\%} binary operator. \cr \cr
        Be aware that in the case of parallel computations, any progress updates are only rough estimates of the current progress and remaining runtime.
        Since the parallel processes are not inter-connected, the estimates are based on the
        progress itself and therefore highly unreliable if the fraction of processes to workers is
        relatively low.

# As we can see, foo and bar have different results. A lower FST generally gives more power, but it
# it risks the possibility to be too strict and consequently *decreasing* power.
