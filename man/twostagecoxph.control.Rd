\title{Ancillary arguments for controlling the operation of the two stage method using twostagecoxph}
\usage{
twostagecoxph.control(
  report.lowest.amount = 5,
  return.raw = FALSE,
  progress = 1000,
  max.coef = 5,
  max.batchsize = 1000,
  upper.bound.correlation = 0.9
)
}
\arguments{
\item{report.lowest.amount}{integer, default 5; denotes how many of the most significant interactions
the function should report. Altering this value does
not affect the maximum reported by the print.twostageGWAS function}

\item{return.raw}{logical, default FALSE; whether or not the output should contain the raw p-values or
the multiple hypotheses corrected p-values.}

\item{progress}{numeric, default 1000;  how many iterations should pass silently until an update is given
about runtime and progress until completion of stages. Set to 0 for no output.}

\item{max.coef}{numeric, default 5; maximum value for all coefficients in the fitted models. If any
are larger than this (in absolute value), then the model rejected and ignored in
further analysis.}

\item{max.batchsize}{maximum size of one batch, default 1000; for parallel computing,
should be lowered if issues arise concerning memory. Can be raised
to slightly increase performance}

\item{upper.bound.correlation}{numeric; the upper bound on the correlation between two
covariates. If exceeded (in absolute value), the model
is not fitted.}
}
\value{
a list containing the values of each of the above constants.
}
\description{
This is used to set various numeric parameters controlling the operation of the
two stage method performed by \code{twostagecoxph}. Typically it would only be used
in a call to \code{twostagecoxph}.
